# Java 8 Streams and Lambdas Examples

This repository contains Java 8 code examples to help you understand and practice key concepts like:

- ✅ Lambda Expressions
- ✅ Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Supplier, Function)
- ✅ Streams API (Intermediate & Terminal Operations)
- ✅ Collectors and Reduction
- ✅ Optional
- ✅ Method References
- ✅ Primitive Streams
- ✅ Stream Advanced Methods & Real-world Use Cases

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `lambdas/` – Basics of lambda expressions and syntax
- `functionalinterfaces/` – Built-in functional interfaces with examples
- `streams/` – Stream operations: filter, map, collect, groupBy, etc.
- `optional/` – Handling nulls using `Optional`
- `methodreferences/` – Cleaner lambda replacements using method references
- `advanced/` – ✅ Real-world problems using:
    - `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`
    - `flatMap`, `reduce`, `peek`, `skip`, `limit`
    - `Stream.of()`, `generate()`, `iterate()`
    - `Collectors.mapping()`, `joining()`, `toMap()`
    - `parallelStream()` and performance notes

## 💪 Practice Problems

This repo includes a growing collection of **realistic practice problems** to help reinforce your understanding of Java 8 features.

➡️ Navigate to:
- `advanced/StreamAdvancedMethodsProblems.java`

Each problem is:
- Self-contained with an initial setup
- Focused on **one or two stream methods**
- Includes **real-world context** (e.g., employees, emails, numbers)
- **No solutions** are provided — practice writing them on your own!

📘 Perfect for:
- Interview prep
- Assignments
- Daily coding practice

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or Download the Repository
    - **For Public Repositories:**  
      You can clone the repository directly using the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java_Streams_Lambdas.git
      ```
    - **For Private Repositories:**  
      If the repository is private, you’ll need to authenticate yourself first. Use the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java_Streams_Lambdas.git
      ```
        - When prompted, enter your **GitHub username** and **personal access token** (not your password). You can generate a personal access token from your GitHub account settings.
        - Alternatively, you can clone using **SSH** if you have an SSH key set up:
          ```bash
          git clone git@github.com:your-username/Java_Streams_Lambdas.git
          ```
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Go to **File → Open**.
    - Browse to the extracted/cloned folder.
    - Select the project root folder (`Java_Streams_Lambdas`) and click **OK**.

3. Configure Project SDK
    - IntelliJ may prompt you to **set up a Java SDK**.
    - Choose **Java 8 or higher (Used 17 version while creating this project)**.
    - If no SDK is available, click **Add SDK → Download JDK**, select version 8+, and install it.

4. Build and Explore
    - IntelliJ will **index the files** and build the project.
    - Open any `.java` file from the `src` folders.
    - Click the green **▶ Run** icon next to the `main()` method to execute.

5. Practice & Customize
    - Many files contain **realistic coding exercises** (especially under `advanced/`).
    - Practice writing solutions where marked.
    - Modify inputs or methods to explore different behaviors.
